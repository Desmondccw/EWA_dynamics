# EWA Dynamics in random games
Code to simulate continuous EWA-learning dynamics over randomly initialised payoff matrices. This aims to replicate the setup in 'Complex dynamics in learning complicated games' by Galla and Farmer (https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1109672110).

In each game, we could vary:

r- The (inverse) exploration parameter

N- Number of actions

Gamma- A correlation parameter in the payoff matrix
